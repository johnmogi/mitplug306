Thanks ‚Äî this is a **clear, high-priority debugging situation**, and it absolutely makes sense to break it down **step by step**, fixing what *actually works*, not just closing tickets.

We'll go one issue at a time until each one is **visibly resolved and tested**, and I won‚Äôt consider anything *done* until you explicitly confirm it. ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ STEP 1: Set Calendar as Default View (in Admin)

### Goal:

* When opening the admin page:
  **`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mitnafun-order-admin`**,
  the **"Booking Calendar" tab** should be opened **by default**.
* The calendar should **load in "week view"**.

---

### üîç Analysis:

You mentioned this anchor exists:

```html
<a href="#mitnafun-tab-calendar" tabindex="-1" class="ui-tabs-anchor" id="ui-id-4">Booking Calendar</a>
```

Which likely corresponds to:

```html
<div id="mitnafun-tab-calendar">...</div>
```

You're probably using jQuery UI tabs or a similar tab system.

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Force Booking Calendar tab to load first

Add this JavaScript to your admin page (enqueue it or include in the footer):

```js
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
  // Set the calendar tab as default after DOM ready
  if (window.location.href.includes('page=mitnafun-order-admin')) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      // Trigger the click on calendar tab
      $('a[href="#mitnafun-tab-calendar"]').trigger('click');
    }, 200); // delay ensures DOM + tabs are ready
  }
});
```

> üîÅ If it still opens another tab first, we can override the `active` tab index in the jQuery UI `tabs()` call (if that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs initialized). Let me know if you want that too.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Force **Week View** as the Calendar‚Äôs default

Assuming you're using **FullCalendar**, this is typically handled in the `FullCalendar` init:

```js
$('#mitnafun-calendar').fullCalendar({
  defaultView: 'timeGridWeek', // or 'agendaWeek' depending on version
  // other config...
});
```

If you're using FullCalendar v5+, this should be:

```js
var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(document.getElementById('mitnafun-calendar'), {
  initialView: 'timeGridWeek',
  // ...
});
calendar.render();
```

> üõë If your code is using `defaultView: 'month'`, that‚Äôs the problem.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: Resize Bug ‚Äî Calendar loads with height/width = 0

You mentioned this line helped:

```css
table.fc-col-header {
  min-width: 100%;
}
```

But the root cause is likely: the calendar is being initialized **before the tab is visible** (i.e. `display: none`).

That breaks FullCalendar's rendering.

### ‚úÖ Best Fix:

```js
$('a[href="#mitnafun-tab-calendar"]').on('click', function () {
  setTimeout(function () {
    if (window.calendar) {
      window.calendar.render(); // fullCalendar v5+
    } else {
      $('#mitnafun-calendar').fullCalendar('render'); // fullCalendar v3
    }
  }, 200);
});
```

> This ensures the calendar re-renders *after* its tab becomes visible.

Would you like me to go ahead and provide **step 2 (gridcell visibility fix)** now?
Or wait for your confirmation that step 1 is fully working as expected?
